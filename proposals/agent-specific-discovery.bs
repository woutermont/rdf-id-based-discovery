# Terminology # {#terms}

<pre class="metadata">
Ignored Terms: Resource, Source, RDF Document, Entity, Identity, Identifier, Document, Identity Document, Dereferenceable Identifier, RDF-Dereferenceable Identifier, Information, Representation, Referent
</pre>

This document borrows the definitions of [=Resource=], [=Source=] and [=RDF Document=] from [[RDF-CONCEPTS]], as well as the following definitions from [[RDFID]]: [=Entity=], [=Identity=], [=Identifier=], [=Document=], [=Identity Document=], [=Dereferenceable Identifier=], [=RDF-Dereferenceable Identifier=], [=Information=], [=Representation=], [=Referent=]. Furthermore, it uses the terms [=Agent=], [=Server=] and [=Client=] in the following sense.

: <dfn>Agent</dfn>
:: An [=Entity=] that acts, either on its own or via some other [=Agent=].

: <dfn>Server</dfn>
:: An [=Agent=] capable of receiving requests, and serving responses to those requests.

: <dfn>Client</dfn>
:: An [=Agent=] interacting with a [=Server=], by sending requests and receiving responses.


# Introduction # {#sec-intro}

When an [=Agent=] wishes to *discover* [=Information=] about an [=Entity=] (e.g. a person, document or API), and the possible ways to interact with that [=Entity=], the [=Agent=] typically starts its inquiry at one or more *initial* [=Source|Sources=] of [=Information=], such as the [=Identity Document=] (e.g. a [[WEBID|WebID Document]]) corresponding to one of the [=Entity|Entity's=] [=Identifier|Identifiers=] (e.g. a [[WEBID|WebID]]). In the [=Representations=] of these initial [=Source|Sources=], other [=Resources=] might be referenced, which in turn might be further [=Source|Sources=] of [=Information=].

An [=Entity=] exposing [=Resources=] to [=Agents=] might want to restrict the access to certain [=Resources=] to certain [=Agents=] or groups of [=Agents=]. We use *access* here in a broad sense, indicating the usefulness or lack thereof of a [=Resource=] for an [=Agent=]. Such access restrictions might be necessary because of privacy or security concerns, or to provide [=Information=] specific to those [=Agents=]: tailored indexes, user preferences, application state and metadata etc. This leads to the following question: how can an [=Agent=] discover these [=Agent-Specific Resources=] between all [=Resources=] related to an [=Entity=], in a performant, secure, and privacy-minded manner? 

This specification defines an <dfn lt="Agent-Specific Resource">Agent-Specific Resource</dfn>: a [=Resource=] related to an [=Entity=] an [=Agent=] wishes to interact with, which accessible by and possibly relevant for that [=Agent=].

</pre>

Given a complete set [R] of [=Resources=] discoverable by an [=Agent=] [A] with respect to an [=Entity=], let [PART] be the partition of [R] into the set [Y] of [ASR]s and the set [N] of other [=Resources=]. Lacking any further information, the performance of [A] will correlate with [PERF]. While this might work for toy examples and proofs of concept, it is not scalable: for increasing [SIZE], [A] would spend ever more time in a trial-and-error search for its [ASR]s.

  Note: This is the approach taken in [[WEBID-PROFILE]] and [[TYPE-INDEXES]].

This document specifies a way to discover an [=Agent's=] [ASR]s relating to an [=Entity=] without having to try *all* discoverable [=Resources=] related to that [=Entity=], using a *single* [=Source=] of [=Information=] that can provide the [=Agent=] with (only) the limited set of [ASR]s, based on the [=Identity=] of the [=Agent=].


# Resource Discovery Hub # {#sec-resource-disovery-hub}

As explained in [#sec-intro], [=Agents=] cannot simply rely on trial-and-error to discover their [=Agent-Specific Resources=] related to an [=Entity=], since this results in an unscalable performance. Instead, an [=Entity=] could expose a single [=Source=] of [=Information=], at which each [=Agent=] can identify itself in return for its [=Agent-Specific Resources=] (if it has any). Let's call this [=Endpoint=] the <span id="dfn-rdh"><dfn lt="RDH|Hub|Resource Discovery Hub">Resource Discovery Hub</dfn>: a micro-[=Server=], linked to an [=Entity=], providing [=Client=] [=Agents=] interacting with that [=Entity=] quick access to their [=Agent-Specific Resources=].</span>

<pre class="metadata">
Text Macro: RDH <l>[=Resource Discovery Hub=]</l>
</pre>

  NOTE: The concept of a [RDH] is based on an abstraction of the [Authorization Agent](https://solid.github.io/data-interoperability-panel/specification/#authorization-agent-discovery) of [INTEROP], in its role as discovery mechanism.


## Considerations ## {#sec-considerations}

[NONORM]

Some considerations can be made when conceptualising the [RDH], and its relation to other [=Resources=] and the inquiring [=Client=].

. In order to use a [RDH] to discover the [ASR]s related to an [=Entity=], the [=Client=] should be able to discover the [RDH] starting from a [=Dereferenceable Identifier=] of that [=Entity=]. 

. It should be possible, but not necessary, to integrate the [RDH] into other services, such as the [=Dereferenceable Identifier=] provider. This would, for example, allow for optimization of the [[#sec-asr-discovery]].

  - The response provided by the [RDH] should be applicable to all document types the other service might respond with.

  - The response provided by a [RDH] should be minimal, as not to cause to much bloat in case the purpose of the request was purely the result provided by the other service.

  - [ASR]s might not always be related to the [=Entity=] in the same way that the response of the other service is. The [=Client=] should therefore always be capable of distinguishing the different parts of the combined response.

  - While a read operation on the combined service might combine the info of both services, the presence of the [RDH] should not disturb the other operations on the other service (e.g. write operations).

. Since [ASR]s will in many cases remain the same for long periods of time, [ASR]s presented by the [RDH] should be cacheable by the [=Client=].

Based on these considerations, the following sections will specify [[#sec-rdh-discovery]] and [[#sec-asr-discovery]].


# Discovery of the Resource Discovery Hub # {#sec-rdh-discovery}

  NOTE: This section takes inspiration from the [Authorization Agent Discovery](https://solid.github.io/data-interoperability-panel/specification/#authorization-agent-discovery) of [INTEROP].

[=Clients=] wishing to discover the [RDH] for a given [=Entity=] <em class="rfc2119">SHOULD</em> dereference the [=Identifier=] `<id>` of that [=Entity=]. 

If the response contains an [[!RFC8288|HTTP Link header]] with <mark>relation</mark> type `rel="TBD"`, the [=Client=] <em class="rfc2119">SHOULD</em> take the link target of the header to be the IRI of the [RDH] of the [=Entity=]. 

If no such header is present, and the response contains an [[!RDF-CONCEPTS|RDF 1.1]] [=RDF Document=], the [=Client=] <em class="rfc2119">MAY</em> parse it. If the document contains a <mark>statement of the form</mark> `<id> <TBD> <rdh>`, the [=Client=] <em class="rfc2119">SHOULD</em> take the value `rdh` to be the IRI of the [RDH] of the [=Entity=]. 

  ISSUE: Relation type TBD (marked)

Each [=Entity=] <em class="rfc2119">SHOULD</em> only have a single [RDH] related to it. The IRI of this [RDH] <em class="rfc2119">MUST</em> be unique to that [=Entity=]. In scenarios where a [RDH] services [=Clients=] for multiple [=Entity|Entities=], this may be facilitated through a unique sub-domain or path.

  ISSUE: Advantages of multiple RDHs?

In case a [=Client=] has found no [RDH] in the response header or body after dereferencing an [=Entity|Entity's=] [=Identifier=] to the [=Entity|Entity's=] [=Identity Document=], the requesting [=Client=] <em class="rfc2119">SHOULD</em> take there to be no [RDH] for that [=Entity=], and the [=Client=] <em class="rfc2119">SHOULD</em> take this [=Identity Document=] to contain the only [=Information=] immediately available.


# Agent-Specific Resource Discovery # {#sec-asr-discovery}

  NOTE: This section takes inspiration from the [Agent Registration Discovery](https://solid.github.io/data-interoperability-panel/specification/#agent-registration-discovery) of [INTEROP].

Once the [RDH] related to an [=Entity=] is known, a [=Client=] wishing to discover its [ASR]s related to that [=Entity=] <em class="rfc2119">SHOULD</em> query the [RDH] by sending an [[!RFC9110|HTTP]] `HEAD` or `GET` request to the [RDH]'s IRI, in which the value of the [[!RFC9110|HTTP]] `Authorization` header is set to a <mark>TBD Token</mark> containing the <mark>[=Identifier=] of the [=Client=]</mark>.

  ISSUE: claims TBD

  ISSUE: oauth access token, oidc id token, or more general (e.g. HttpSig, VC in body...) ?

  ISSUE: need for Entity's ID as well ?

Upon receiving a request, the [RDH] <em class="rfc2119">MUST</em> check the validity of the <mark>TBD Token</mark>. If the <mark>TBD Token</mark> is valid, the [RDH] <em class="rfc2119">MUST</em> send a response including, for each [ASR] `<asr>` of the requesting [=Client=], an [[!RFC9110|HTTP]] `Link` header with `<asr>` as target value and the relevant link type relating it to the [=Entity=]; or, in case no [ASR] was found for the requesting [=Client=], no (extra)  [[!RFC9110|HTTP]] `Link` headers.

In case the [=Client=] receives a response from the [RDH] with no [[!RFC9110|HTTP]] `Link` header, the requesting [=Client=] <em class="rfc2119">SHOULD</em> take the [=Identity Document=] of the [=Entity=] to contain the only [=Information=] immediately available.

To reduce header bloat, a [RDH] <em class="rfc2119">SHOULD</em> only advertise a single [ASR] to the requesting [=Client=]. In scenarios where a [RDH] has multiple [ASR]s for the requesting [=Client=], the [RDH] <em class="rfc2119">SHOULD</em> provide an <dfn lt="Agent-Specific Discovery Document">Agent-Specific Discovery Document</dfn>, encoding an RDF Graph relating the [=Entity=] to each of the [ASR]s with the relevant link type. The single [ASR] communicated in the response should then be the IRI of that [=Agent-Specific Discovery Document=].
