This document relies heavily on some of the concepts and architecture defined in [INTEROP]. It borrows the definitions of [=Resource=], [=RDF Source=] and [=RDF Document=] from [[RDF11-CONCEPTS|RDF 1.1]], as well as the following definitions from [[CON-WEB-REP|Concepts in Web Representation]]: [=Entity=], [=Identity=], [=Identifier=], [=Source=], [=Document=], [=Identity Document=], [=Dereferenceable Identifier=], [=RDF-Dereferenceable Identifier=], [=Information=], [=Representation=] and [=Referent=]. Furthermore, it uses the terms [=Agent=], [=Server=] and [=Client=] in the following sense.

: <dfn>Agent</dfn>
:: An [=Entity=] that acts, either on its own or via some other [=Agent=]. This corresponds to the notion of [=Agents=] as defined in [INTEROP].

: <dfn>Server</dfn>
:: An [=Agent=] capable of receiving requests, and serving responses to those requests.

: <dfn>Client</dfn>
:: An [=Agent=] interacting with a [=Server=], by sending requests and receiving responses.


# Introduction # {#sec-intro}

When an [=Agent=] wishes to *discover* [=Information=] about an [=Entity=] (e.g. a person, document or API), and the possible ways to interact with that [=Entity=], the [=Agent=] typically starts its inquiry at one or more *initial [=Source=] of [=Information=]*, such as the [=Identity Document=] corresponding to one of the [=Entity's=] [=Identifier=] (e.g. the [=Profile Document=] of a [=WebID=] or [=DID Document=] of a [=Decentralized Identifier=]). In the [=Representations=] of these initial [=Source=], other [=Resources=] might be referenced, which in turn might be further [=Source=] of [=Information=].

An [=Entity=] exposing [=Resources=] to [=Agents=] might want to restrict the access to certain [=Resources=] to certain [=Agents=] or groups of [=Agents=]. We use *access* here in a broad sense, indicating the usefulness or lack thereof of a [=Resource=] to an [=Agent=]. Such access restrictions might be necessary because of privacy or security concerns, or to provide [=Information=] specific to those [=Agents=]: tailored indexes, user preferences, application state ... in other words, the <span id="dfn-asr"><dfn>Agent-Specific Resources</dfn>: <em>[=Resources=] related to an [=Entity=] an [=Agent=] wishes to interact with, which are accessible by and possibly relevant for that [=Agent=].</em></span> This leads to the following question: how can an [=Agent=] discover these [ASRS] between all other [=Resources=] related to an [=Entity=], in a performant, secure, and privacy-minded manner? 

  NOTE: The concept of an [ASR] is based on an abstraction of the [=AR|Agent Registration=] of [INTEROP], in its role as provider of agent-specific information. They divide [=Agents=] into [=Social Agents=] and [=App|Applications=]: <q><em>[=Social Agents=] manage the other [Agents] they interact with by registering these [=Agents=] in their [=AR|Agent Registry=]. A [=Social Agent Registration=] provides the [=Social Agent=] with a place to track and manage other [=Social Agents=] they interact with. An [=Application Registration=] provides the [=Social Agent=] with a place to maintain metadata, state, preferences, and other application-specific data associated with a given [=App|Application=] they have elected to use.</em></q>

</pre>

Given a complete set [R] of [=Resources=] discoverable by an [=Agent=] [A] with respect to a certain [=Entity=], let [PART] be the partition of [R] into the set [Y] of [ASRS] and the set [N] of other [=Resources=]. Lacking any further information, the performance of [A] will correlate with [PERF]. While this might work for toy examples and proofs of concept, it is not scalable: for increasing [SIZE], [A] would spend ever more time in a trial-and-error search for its [ASRS].

  Note: This is the approach taken in the [PROF] and [TI] specifications.

This document specifies a way to discover an [=Agent's=] [ASRS] relating to an [=Entity=] without having to try *all* discoverable [=Resources=] related to that [=Entity=], using a *single* [=Source=] of [=Information=] that can provide the [=Agent=] with *only* the limited set of [ASRS], based on the [=Identity=] of the [=Agent=].


# Resource Discovery Hub # {#sec-resource-disovery-hub}

As explained in [#sec-intro], [=Agents=] cannot simply rely on trial-and-error to discover their [ASRS] related to an [=Entity=], since this results in an unscalable performance. Instead, an [=Entity=] could expose a single [=Source=] of [=Information=], at which each [=Agent=] can identify itself in return for its [ASRS] (if it has any). Let's call this [=Resource=] the <span id="dfn-rdh"><dfn>Resource Discovery Hub</dfn>: a [=Server=] [=Resource=], linked to an [=Entity=], that provides [=Client=] [=Agents=] interacting with that [=Entity=] quick access to their [ASRS].</span>

  NOTE: The concept of a [RDH] is based on an abstraction of the [=Authorization Agent=] of [INTEROP], in its role as mechanism for [=Agent Registration Discovery=]: <q><em>An [=Agent=] that needs to discover whether a target [=Social Agent=] has a corresponding [=AR|Agent Registration=] for them can query the [=Authorization Agent=] for that target [=Social Agent=].</em></q>


## Considerations ## {#sec-considerations}

[NONORM]

Some considerations can be made when conceptualizing the [RDH], and its relation to other [=Resources=] and inquiring [=Clients=].

1. In order to use a [RDH] to discover the [ASRS] related to an [=Entity=], the [=Client=] should be able to discover the [RDH] starting from a [=Dereferenceable Identifier=] of that [=Entity=]. 

2. It should be possible, but not necessary, to integrate the [RDH] into other services, such as the [=Dereferenceable Identifier=] provider. This would, for example, allow for optimization of the [[#sec-asr-discovery]].

    1. The response provided by the [RDH] should be applicable to all document types the other service might respond with.

    2. The response provided by a [RDH] should be minimal, as not to cause too much bloat in case the purpose of a request was purely the response provided by the other service.

    3. [ASRS] might not always be related to the [=Entity=] in the same way that the response of the other service is. The [=Client=] should therefore always be capable of distinguishing the different parts of the combined response.

    4. While a read operation on the combined service might combine the info of both services (in a distinguishable way), the presence of the [RDH] should not disturb the other operations on the other service (e.g. write operations).

3. Since [ASRS] will in many cases remain the same for long periods of time, [ASRS] presented by the [RDH] should be cacheable by the [=Client=].

Based on these considerations, the following sections will specify [[#sec-rdh-discovery]] and [[#sec-asr-discovery]].


# Discovery of the Resource Discovery Hub # {#sec-rdh-discovery}

  NOTE: This section takes inspiration from the [=Authorization Agent Discovery=] of [INTEROP].

[=Clients=] wishing to discover the [RDH] for a given [=Entity=] <em class="rfc2119">SHOULD</em> dereference an [=Identifier=] `<id>` of that [=Entity=]. 

If the response contains an [[!RFC8288|HTTP Link header]] with <mark>relation</mark> type `rel="TBD"`, the [=Client=] <em class="rfc2119">SHOULD</em> take the link target of the header to be the IRI of the [RDH] of the [=Entity=]. 

If **no** such header is present, and the response contains an [=RDF Document=], the [=Client=] <em class="rfc2119">MAY</em> parse it. If the document contains a <mark>statement of the form</mark> `<id> <TBD> <rdh>`, the [=Client=] <em class="rfc2119">SHOULD</em> take the object value `<rdh>` to be the IRI of the [RDH] of the [=Entity=]. 

<figure>
    <figcaption>Example GET request to an [=Entity=] [=Identifier=] and two possible responses.</figcaption>
    <pre highlight=http line-highlight=1 class="example">
        GET <id> HTTP/1.1
    </pre>
    <pre highlight=http line-highlight=2 class="example">
        HTTP/1.1 200 OK
        Link: &lt;rdh&gt;; rel="TBD"
    </pre>
    <pre highlight=http line-highlight=3 class="example">
        HTTP/1.1 200 OK
        &nbsp;
        &lt;id&gt; &lt;TBD&gt; &lt;rdh&gt; .
    </pre>
</figure>

  ISSUE: Relation type TBD (marked)

Each [=Entity=] <em class="rfc2119">SHOULD</em> only have a single [RDH] related to it. The IRI of that [RDH] <em class="rfc2119">MUST</em> be unique to that [=Entity=]. In scenarios where a [RDH] services [=Clients=] for multiple [=Entity|Entities=], this may be facilitated through a unique sub-domain or path.

  ISSUE: Advantages of multiple RDHs?

In case a [=Client=] has found no [RDH] in the response header or body after dereferencing an [=Entity|Entity's=] [=Identifier=] to the [=Entity|Entity's=] [=Identity Document=], the requesting [=Client=] <em class="rfc2119">SHOULD</em> take there to be **no** [RDH] for that [=Entity=], and the [=Client=] <em class="rfc2119">SHOULD</em> take the [=Identity Document=] to contain the only [=Information=] immediately available.


# Agent-Specific Resource Discovery # {#sec-asr-discovery}

  NOTE: This section takes inspiration from the [Agent Registration Discovery](https://solid.github.io/data-interoperability-panel/specification/#agent-registration-discovery) of [INTEROP].

Once the [RDH] related to an [=Entity=] is known, a [=Client=] wishing to discover its [ASRS] related to that [=Entity=] <em class="rfc2119">SHOULD</em> query the [RDH] by sending an [[!RFC9110|HTTP]] `HEAD` or `GET` request to the [RDH]'s IRI, in which the value of the [[!RFC9110|HTTP]] `Authorization` header is set to a <mark>TBD Token</mark> containing the <mark>[=Identifier=] of the [=Client=]</mark>.

<figure>
    <figcaption>Example HEAD request to an [RDH].</figcaption>
    <pre highlight=http class="example">
        HEAD <id> HTTP/1.1
        Authorization: TBD ...
    </pre>
</figure>

  ISSUE: claims TBD

  ISSUE: oauth access token, oidc id token, or more general (e.g. HttpSig, VC in body...) ?

  ISSUE: need for Entity's ID as well ?

Upon receiving a request, the [RDH] <em class="rfc2119">MUST</em> check the validity of the <mark>TBD Token</mark>. If the <mark>TBD Token</mark> is valid, the [RDH] <em class="rfc2119">MUST</em> send a response including, for each [ASR] `<asr>` of the requesting [=Client=], an [[!RFC9110|HTTP]] `Link` header with `<asr>` as target value and the relevant link type relating it to the [=Entity=]; or, in case no [ASR] was found for the requesting [=Client=], no (extra)  [[!RFC9110|HTTP]] `Link` headers.

<figure>
    <figcaption>Example response from an [RDH].</figcaption>
    <pre highlight=http line-highlight=2 class="example">
        HTTP/1.1 200 OK
        Link: &lt;link-type&gt;; rel="&lt;asr&gt;"
    </pre>
</figure>

In case the [=Client=] receives a response from the [RDH] with no [[!RFC9110|HTTP]] `Link` header, the requesting [=Client=] <em class="rfc2119">SHOULD</em> take the [=Identity Document=] of the [=Entity=] to contain the only [=Information=] immediately available.

To reduce header bloat, a [RDH] <em class="rfc2119">SHOULD</em> only advertise a single [ASR] to the requesting [=Client=]. In scenarios where a [RDH] has multiple [ASRS] for the requesting [=Client=], the [RDH] <em class="rfc2119">SHOULD</em> provide an <dfn lt="Agent-Specific Discovery Document">Agent-Specific Discovery Document</dfn>, encoding an RDF Graph relating the [=Entity=] to each of the [ASRS] with the relevant link type. The single [ASR] communicated in the response should then be the IRI of that [=Agent-Specific Discovery Document=].
