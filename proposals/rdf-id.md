# RDF-Identifiers

An **Identifier** is _a token that uniquely represents an Entity_. 
If we call _any identifier that can be dereferenced to a resource_ a **dereferenceable identifier**, 
we can define an **RDF-dereferenceable identifier**, or **RDF-ID** for short, 
as _a dereferenceable identifier that dereferences to an RDF resource_. 
An RDF-ID can then be said to be the first **Entry Point** into knowledge of and interaction with the Entity it refers to.

One example of such RDF-IDs are WebIDs: a HTTP(s)-identifier that denotes an Agent and dereferences to an RDF document 
which the user controls and which uniquely describes that Agent in relation to that WebID. 
That is to say, RDF-IDs form a superset of WebIDs.
