# RDF-Identifiers

## Terminology

An **identifier** is _a token that uniquely represents an identity_. 
If we call _any identifier that can be dereferenced to a resource_ a **dereferenceable identifier**, 
we can define an **RDF-dereferenceable identifier**, or **RDF-ID** for short, 
as _a dereferenceable identifier that dereferences to an RDF resource_. 
One example of such RDF-IDs are WebIDs: a HTTP(s)-identifier that denotes an Agent and dereferences to an RDF document 
which the user controls and which uniquely describes that Agent in relation to that WebID. 
That is to say, RDF-ID forms a subset of WebID.
